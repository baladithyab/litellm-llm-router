"""
HTTP Client Pool - Shared Outbound HTTP Client Management
==========================================================

Provides a shared httpx.AsyncClient pool for outbound HTTP requests,
eliminating per-request client instantiation overhead and enabling
proper connection pooling.

Features:
- Singleton AsyncClient with configurable limits
- Proper lifecycle management (startup/shutdown hooks)
- Feature flag for rollback safety (ROUTEIQ_HTTP_CLIENT_POOLING_ENABLED)
- Instrumentation hooks for tracking instantiation counts

Usage:
    from litellm_llmrouter.http_client_pool import get_http_client

    # In async context
    client = get_http_client()
    response = await client.get("https://example.com")

Lifecycle:
    # On app startup (called by gateway/app.py)
    await startup_http_client_pool()

    # On app shutdown
    await shutdown_http_client_pool()

Rollback Safety:
    Set ROUTEIQ_HTTP_CLIENT_POOLING_ENABLED to false to disable pooling and
    fall back to per-request client creation. Default is 'true'.

See: https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/#client-instances
