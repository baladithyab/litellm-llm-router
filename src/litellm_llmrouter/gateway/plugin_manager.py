Plugin Manager for Gateway Extensibility
=========================================

This module provides a production-ready plugin lifecycle interface for extending the gateway.

Plugins can hook into:
- startup(app, context): Called after the FastAPI app is created but before server starts
- shutdown(app, context): Called during application shutdown

Features:
- **Capabilities**: Plugins declare what they provide (ROUTES, ROUTING_STRATEGY, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Plugins can declare depends_on for load ordering
- **Priority**: Numeric priority for tie-breaking (lower = earlier)
- **Failure Modes**: Per-plugin behavior on failure (continue, abort, quarantine)
- **Security Policy**: Only plugins with allowed capabilities can load
- **Allowlist**: Optional plugin allowlist for explicit control

Usage:
    from litellm_llmrouter.gateway.plugin_manager import (
        GatewayPlugin,
        PluginCapability,
        PluginManager,
        PluginMetadata,
        FailureMode,
    )

    class MyPlugin(GatewayPlugin):
        @property
        def metadata(self) -> PluginMetadata:
            return PluginMetadata(
                name="my-plugin",
                version="1.0.0",
                capabilities={PluginCapability.ROUTES},
                priority=100,
            )

        async def startup(self, app, context):
            print("Plugin starting up!")

        async def shutdown(self, app, context):
            print("Plugin shutting down!")

Configuration (Environment Variables):
    - LLMROUTER_PLUGINS: Comma-separated list of plugin module paths to load
      Example: LLMROUTER_PLUGINS=mypackage.plugin1.MyPlugin,mypackage.plugin2.AnotherPlugin

    - LLMROUTER_PLUGINS_ALLOWLIST: Comma-separated list of allowed plugin paths
      If set, only plugins in this list can be loaded. Empty means all are allowed.
      Example: LLMROUTER_PLUGINS_ALLOWLIST=mypackage.plugin1.MyPlugin,mypackage.plugin2.AnotherPlugin

    - LLMROUTER_PLUGINS_ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES: Comma-separated list of allowed capabilities
      If set, plugins requesting disallowed capabilities are rejected.
      Example: LLMROUTER_PLUGINS_ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES=ROUTES,OBSERVABILITY_EXPORTER

    - LLMROUTER_PLUGINS_FAILURE_MODE: Global default failure mode (continue|abort|quarantine)
      Default: continue (plugin failure doesn't stop startup)
