"""
TG10.5 Streaming Performance Gate Integration Test

This test boots a compose stack with `finch compose` and validates:
- TTFB (Time To First Byte) is below a conservative threshold
- Chunk cadence: markers are received over time (not buffered/burst)

The test uses a deterministic streaming stub that emits markers at
precise intervals. Any buffering in the gateway would cause:
- High TTFB (> total_duration/3)
- Burst arrival of markers at the end

Test Configuration (via environment variables):
    STREAMING_PERF_CONCURRENCY: Number of parallel requests (default: 10)
    STREAMING_PERF_MARKER_COUNT: Markers per stream (default: 20)
    STREAMING_PERF_INTERVAL_MS: Interval between markers (default: 100ms)
    STREAMING_PERF_TTFB_MAX_MS: Maximum acceptable TTFB (default: 500ms)

Usage:
    # Run the test (compose up/down handled automatically)
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_streaming_perf_gate.py -v

    # With custom concurrency
    STREAMING_PERF_CONCURRENCY=20 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_streaming_perf_gate.py -v

Prerequisites:
    - finch (or Docker) CLI installed
    - Access to docker-compose.streaming-perf.yml
